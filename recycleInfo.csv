0,Aluminum Recycling,"Aluminum isn’t something that many of think about in terms of recycling. However, we need to change that mindset.","Aluminum isn’t something that many of think about in terms of recycling. However, we need to change that mindset. Sure, it is a very abundant resource out there but at the rate we use it up the amount may not last as long as we are thinking that it will. About half of all aluminum cans for food and other items are recycled. Yet there is plenty of room for that amount to substantially increase. With so many places to take aluminum to donate as scrap there is no reason at all to toss it out. There are very few communities out there that don’t have any type of location to take aluminum. Some of them only take cans and others take all items. Before you toss another tin can in the trash you need to remember this fact. Just one aluminum can that is recycled can save enough energy to keep a 100 watt light bulb burning for about 4 hours. The fact that the average household uses thousands of cans made from aluminum annually means that you can create plenty of energy for all of your electronic device use. It isn’t just cans though that people can recycle and that is very important. For example aluminum foil can definitely be tossed into that category. Even some lawn furniture can fall into that category too due to the frames being made out of metal. Even old gutters from your home can be recycled. If you have any forms of scrap aluminum then by all means you need to be recycling them. They can take up a ton of room in the landfill and that isn’t necessary. All aluminum is considered residue and it is condensed into slabs that are crushed and shredded. This removes all of the paint on the aluminum and any labels. The mixture is about 50% recycled materials and then 50% new materials to create the items. The melted down aluminum can be placed into molds of any shape and size to create them. The molds are designed to fit the needs of the companies that need them to place their products into. The process of recycling aluminum can cut down on a significant amount of natural resources being used up. For example in 2007 the 54 billion cans that were recycled helped to reduce the consumption of 15 million barrels of crude oil. Since we are already too dependent on oil this is a huge benefit from aluminum recycling. This can also reduce the cost of canned products too and that is a nice benefit to consumers. This type of material can be recycled quite a few times before it can’t be used any more due to quality. The fact that people get paid to turn in aluminum also helps this to be a common recycling benefit. The pay out each year is close to $800 million to individuals and to various organizations. The process of recycling aluminum cans for the food industry is very common. In fact, many factories rely on this process to help them cut down production costs. It is estimated that within 60 days of an aluminum can being placed for recycling it can be processed, filled with new food, and back on the shelf in a grocery store. The process is extremely fast thanks to the technology that we have today. It is estimated that about 113,000 aluminum cans are recycled every single minute. The best part is that it only takes about 5% of the energy to make new aluminum cans. One pound of aluminum cans is equal to 34 empty cans."
1,Battery Recycling,Alkaline batteries that we commonly use at home for various gadgets have mercury in them that is very dangerous to the environment.,"We rely on batteries for our electronics including  computers, laptops, music players, mobile phones, and video game consoles. Of course we also rely on them for powering our vehicles. While batteries today have a longer life span than in the past they still will eventually run out. Try to have a battery charger at home that you can put small batters into. Many of them charge AA, AAA, C, D, and the square 9 volts. Then you can reuse them instead of tossing them out. However, there will eventually come a time when the batteries do have to be tossed out. What do you do? Most people simply place them into the trash can without a second thought. Yet batteries have toxins in them that are very dangerous. The goal should be to keep them out of landfills so that those chemicals don’t ruin our soil, water, and air. Alkaline batteries that we commonly use at home for various gadgets have mercury in them that is very dangerous to the environment. Many of them say that they are mercury free but according to the EPA they still have traces of it. You may have to mail in those batteries though to get them recycled. There are very few community projects that include this type of item. Two of the companies that you can look for information online about are Battery Solutions Inc. and The Big Green Box. You do have to pay but only for the cost of shipping the box that the batteries are in to them. It is a very small price to pay in order to clean up our environment. These companies have precise methods that will incinerate the batteries. However, they trap the chemicals and gas so that they aren’t out there in our environment causing havoc. Zinc gases that come from alkaline batteries are often captured so that they can be used again for making various forms of metal alloys non corrosive. Recycling vehicle batteries is very important due to the acid that they contain. The elements in them are 97% recyclable though. When you buy a new battery usually they will offer you a lower price with your old battery in exchange. This is called a core. They will take care of properly getting that old battery recycled. If you buy a battery though without trading one in you may have that old one in your garage. It really isn’t a good idea to have it there. Yet you can’t put it in the trash can or the landfill so what do you do? Contact AAA in your area and you may find that they have a drop off location or they will pick it up for you. April 22nd is Earth Day and many entities also sponsor collections of vehicles batteries and other items. The goal is to help with recycling them as much as possible. Each year these efforts seem to be more and more successful. That is very encouraging and sends a message that people are willing to recycle batteries if they know where to take them. When you are taking a battery to be collected make sure you keep it upright. Place it into a bag and into a box if possible. Always wear gloves when you handle it as the acid can be very dangerous to your skin. Wash your hands immediately after touching any battery to help remove anything that may have gotten onto your skin. If you have a battery that is leaking you need to do what you can to contain the situation. Call your local hazardous waste control and see what they can help you to do with the battery. Some of them will come to pick it up at no charge and others have a fee that is assessed to cover their costs."
2,Computer Recycling,When a computer is donated for recycling it is taken apart. It is completely dismantled and all of the parts from it are sorted out. In many instances they are used for learning tools,"Today computers are a huge part of society. We use them every day in business around the world. Most homes have a desktop and it isn’t uncommon for people to also have a laptop too. Where do all of those computers go though when they no longer function? They can take up a mass amount of space in the landfills. Today computer recycling programs are everywhere to help reduce that type of scenario. When you buy a new computer you may be able to donate your old one to that location. Otherwise you may need to check online to see where you can take yours locally. There could be a very small fee too if they come to your home or business to pick up the computer. When a computer is donated for recycling it is taken apart. It is completely dismantled and all of the parts from it are sorted out. In many instances they are used for learning tools. You may want to find out if your local high schools or colleges need them as part of their training curriculum. What can be salvaged from computers can be used again to create new ones. The sell price of refurbished computers is less than a new one. That can be a viable option for someone looking for a great deal on a computer. At the same time it can be useful for those that need a second computer such as a laptop. The EPA has established very stringent guidelines about what constitutes recycled computer too. This means consumers don’t have to fear that they are going to get a dud. The computer can also be your way of reducing waste as you aren’t adding one more of them to a pile that won’t be used. Educators can tell their students that the computers are recycled as a means of helping them to see the connections as well. A refurbished computer has been carefully rebuilt by technicians. They have the right training to know what can be used again and what can’t. Some of the materials are rebuilt so that they can be used too instead of tossed out. The cost of rebuilding those parts is less than making them new from raw materials. Many of the items from a computer that can’t be used again or rebuilt all go into the same pile. They are sent to a plant where they are ground up and then the metal is melted. This allows for the melt to be recycled and used to create new products. The volume of mental that is found in used computers is very high so this is a significant way of helping the environment. There are some elements from computers that are tough to recycle though. For example the old batteries from the motherboard, glass from CRTs that contain lead, and even flat screen monitors that have fluorescent lighting in them due to the fact that they have levels of mercury in them. All of these deemed hazardous parts of computers go into a water processing system. This allows the metals to be removed and then those parts can be disposed of. They take up much less space in a landfill than a full computer would. Computer recycling though is just one way that we can make a huge difference for the environment.  How many electronic devices such as a computer are in your home? Statistically most households have about 25 of them. When one of them is no longer usable don’t just toss it out. Find out if there is a place to recycle it. This can happen for many products including cameras, cell phones, and TVs."
3,E-Cycling,E-cycling refers to the process of recycling electronics. Today there are so many devices that we use for business and for fun. On average a household has more than 20 electronic devices in it.,"E-cycling refers to the process of recycling electronics. Today there are so many devices that we use for business and for fun. On average a household has more than 20 electronic devices in it. Among them are computers, video games, music players, and mobile phones. When they are used up and tossed into landfills they can release chemicals that get into the soil. From there they make it into the underground water and into bodies of water. They also take up a considerable amount of space when you think about the vast amount of these electronics that people go through annually. There is a huge amount of aluminum and mental found in electronics too. When you recycle them it takes about 5% of the amount of energy required to make new items from raw materials. Statistics show that there is enough energy saved annually through recycling a ton of aluminum to offer the average household enough electricity for the next 10 years! This includes your other electronics that you may not replace often. For example TVs can last for decades. VCRs can last that long too as many of them aren’t used often. Some people have CD players that have been around since they came out. Other items such as microwaves though are used often and so they have to be replaced after several years. The amount of space in the landfills that all of these electronics take up is ridiculous in the landfills. Efforts to recycle all of these types of devices continue to be moving forward. For example just 5 years ago there were about 14 million mobile phones recycled. This includes the chargers and the batteries. They can be taken to the provider you have for your mobile phone. When you get an upgrade they will often take the old one if you wish and recycle it for you. The same may be true when you buy a new computer. Ask if they have any type of donation program for recycling that you can contribute to. Then they will take that computer off your hands and you don’t have to worry about it. Some stores are charging a low fee for disposal time and costs but it is really affordable. Instead of keeping an old computer that doesn’t work at your home, donate it. Many colleges use them to teach their students. You can also donate the computer to be recycled. It is amazing that they take it apart, separate the pieces, and reuse every single item that they can. The rest is ground up and then made into other products. Before you throw away any electronic product find out what you can do to donate it. Contact local entities and look around online. Some programs are offered annually through the EPA too. They offer collection sites for such products at no charge. It recent years they have been able to get about 15% of used computers recycled. Still, when you consider about 40 million computers are tossed out annually 15% just isn’t enough. The other 85% are sitting in landfills taking up space and contributing to environmental problems. They can reduce in the environment suffering from mercury, lead, and more. Due to so many efforts in place to recycle electronics there is simply no reason at all to continue tossing them out. Those that have done so mainly did it because they didn’t know such programs existed. Help to spread the word to make sure people know what options they have. This can influence what they will do when they have electronics that no longer work."
4,Glass Recycling,Glass is the one item that can be recycled over and over again. It never looses quality like other products do. Today at least 25% of the glass that is used in items you buy has been recycled.,"Glass is the one item that can be recycled over and over again. It never looses quality like other products do. Today at least 25% of the glass that is used in items you buy has been recycled. The goal is to significantly increase it. In fact, there is absolutely no reason at all for glass to go to the landfills. The quality of it never diminishes after many times of being recycled. When glass is taken to a processing plant, it has to be sorted. Unlike other types of materials for recycling this one can’t all be lumped together. It has to be sorted by color. For example clear bottles, brown bottles, green bottles, etc. This is due to the fact that the colors can affect the types of chemicals that will be used to break down the glass into a usable form. The glass that fits into a given category is smashed into what are known as cullets. They are tiny pieces of glass. This allows any forms of materials or contamination from the inside or outside of the glass to be removed. Labels on the bottles made from paper are also removed. For those bottles that have the label information on them directly, a process called fine sizing takes place to remove it. Next it is all melted so that it is all in a liquid form. If the glass is to be colored then coloring is added so that it will be the right shade. The next steps involve the liquid being poured into molds. This allows them to harden and then you have new glass items. In 2009 approximately 3 million tons of glass was recovered and used for recycling purposes. In some states including California consumers can turn in their glass to be recycled and make money from it. That money adds up quickly to ensure that people are enticed to begin turning in the glass that they use. Even in areas where there is no payment for glass, items can be saved and then returned to a collection area. Many schools and communities off bins for such items to be placed in. Sometimes you will see three trash cans in a row. They are for trash, paper, and for glass. By sorting the items that way it helps to ensure that the entity offering those cans will be able to distribute as much as they can to recycling areas. Recycling just one glass bottle can make a huge difference. It can offer enough power for your computer to last an hour. Given the fact that people use their computers and at home 10 to 12 hours a day it is a huge benefit to be able to save that energy. If you were to recycle all of the glass you use annually, then it would cover all of the use of power for your computer for a year too. It is estimated that by 2013 there will be enough power saved through the recycling of glass to offer 45,000 households energy for an entire year. It will also be enough to take about 180,000 tons of waste from being placed into the landfills. It also costs much less to recycle glass to make new products than it does to create them from raw materials. That amount of landfill area saved in a single year is amazing. Since every bit of glass can be recycled it is a good idea to buy items that are packaged that way instead of plastic as only part of the plastic can be salvaged. Plastic also loses quality the more it is recycled and glass never will."
5,Mobile Phone Recycling,It is amazing to think that just 20 years ago hardly anyone had a mobile phone. Those that did were important business people or rich.,"It is amazing to think that just 20 years ago hardly anyone had a mobile phone. Those that did were important business people or rich. They also had a huge phone to carry around and they couldn’t use it for long before the charge went out. Today though mobile phones are everywhere. Adults have them and most children do too as a means of staying in contact. These phones though continue to astonish us with what they offer. The models range from simply making calls to playing music, playing games, a small office, and even accessing the internet. All of this means that there are tons of mobile phones out there that no longer work. When someone upgrades what do they do with that old phone? It may not seem like a mobile phone tossing into the garbage would matter much. However, there are about 100 million of them added every single year. That is why mobile phone recycling is very important. Should you decide to get a new one as your provider how to recycle the one you have. They may have a program available. You can also seek out a mobile phone recycling location in your community. Always erase all of the data from that phone though before you give it to any recycling location. Do this as a precaution for your own safety. You simply can’t be too careful in today’s society. It isn’t the volume of space that these mobile phones take up that creates a problem. The issue is also that they have lithium ion batteries in them. They can become explosive if they are in the sunlight too long. They can also cause soil contamination and then when water runs through the landfill it can cause that contamination to get into our bodies of water. High levels of various forms of contaminants including lead and mercury can come from mobile phones in the landfills. Yet they can’t always be taken out of the drinking water through the treatment center. None of us want to consume contaminated water so take action to prevent that from happening. Recycling of mobile phones hasn’t caught on like it should. The problem is that most people don’t know about it. Now that you understand the value of it make sure you do it the next time you get a new mobile phone. Tell others too so that there are plenty of people involved. In 2007 only 10% of the mobile phones out there were recycled. We can all make the effort to see that rate skyrocket! What about those mobile phones you have that still work but that you don’t need? For example when your provider offers you a free upgrade to thank you for being a customer? You can find out about how to donate them locally. The police department and the local abuse shelters may collect them to use for those in a crisis situation. The ability to reuse those mobile phones that still operate is very important. Someone who is unable to get their own mobile phone or that is in a crisis doesn’t care that your donation won’t  have the latest features in it. They just want to make sure they can make calls when they have to. If all of this isn’t encouragement enough, consider some of the environmental benefits from mobile phone recycling. For example each phone that is recycled can save enough energy to power a laptop for 44 hours. All of the mobile phones that are added to the landfills annually in the USA offer enough power to provide electricity to 24,000 homes for an entire year!"
6,Paper Recycling,"Paper is something that we use all the time. This is very true in a business setting. The good thing is that paper can easily be recycled. In fact, about 56% of all of it that is consumed annually will be recycled.","Paper is something that we use all the time. This is very true in a business setting. The good thing is that paper can easily be recycled. In fact, about 56% of all of it that is consumed annually will be recycled. The amount continues to increase too and that is something we can all be proud of. The amount of paper recycled annually is enough to equal 360 pounds for every person living in the United States. When a ton of paper is recycled it means that 3.3 cubic yards less is filled up at the landfill. As you can see that means a huge volume of area saved every single year. It is important for businesses, schools, and homes to all do what they can to cut down on paper use. Some ideas include sending emails instead of cards. There are even e-cards offered online that make it possible to send cut animations, graphics, and to type a personal note. All of this can be quickly sent to the people you choose. Get on the list to stop junk mail too so that you won’t have volumes of it coming every single day. Once paper is collected it is taken to a recycling processing location. It is separated based on grade. If the paper has forms of trash or other debris on it those elements have to be removed. Then it is compacted to create large bales where it will be taken to the paper mill for processing. The fibers from the paper are shredded and mixed with water. This process is going to create pulp. That will be washed and refined and then cleaned again. Next it goes through a process with a beater that turns it isn’t a slushy type of substance. That substance is then processed to create various types of paper. You may be interested to learn that paper can typically be recycled up to 7 times before it is no longer good enough quality. When it has been recycled too many times it ends up falling apart and not being able to be part of the overall mixture to create new paper. However, that is a very strong point to make – that paper can be recycled that many times. So when a single piece of it goes to a landfill instead of being recycled it is really costing the environment not just once but quite a few times. The more we recycle paper products the less likely we are going to be cutting down more of the forests. Today the trees are already disappearing at high rates. That process can upset the balance of the living entities of that environment. Plus, it takes many years for trees to grow again once they have been cut down to make paper. It is estimated that 25 million trees are saved annually just due to the process of recycling newspapers. The goal for the industry though is to make sure that 65% of paper is recycled by 2012. If we all continue to take action then that goal can easily be met. Educating each other, reminding each other, and even cutting down on the amount of paper that we use can make a huge difference for the future of our environment. This can allow us to save water and other resources because it takes less to recycle paper than to make it from raw materials. At this point approximately 87% of people living in the United States have some form of paper recycling program in their community. Those that don’t have such programs are strongly encouraged to take action. Talk to community leaders to see how such a program can get off the ground."
7,Plastic Recycling,Plastic recycling is very important due to the amount of it that is used for consumer goods. The majority of plastic stems from people drinking bottled water.,"Plastic recycling is very important due to the amount of it that is used for consumer goods. The majority of plastic stems from people drinking bottled water. Millions of tons of it end up in the landfills or at the bottom of bodies of water every single year. Even with huge efforts in place the problem continues to be out there. The good news is that in 2008 there were 2.4 billion pounds of plastic recycled. They came from consumers, communities, and large factories. While that may seem like a huge amount though it is just a fraction of what we should be recycling. This amount only accounts for about 27% of the overall plastic that is used annually. The rest of it is found as litter, at the bottom of the bodies of water, and in landfills. In some areas the plastic is such a problem for aquatic life that it is stated to be larger than the state of Texas at the bottom of the oceans. That is a huge amount of litter that absolutely could have been prevented if humans had been taking plastic recycling seriously. Even though most of the plastic stems from drinking bottled water there are other culprits. Many people eat on the go and that is where they come from. Deli foods are often in plastic see through containers to make them appealing to consumers. Yogurt is sold in plastic cups. There are fruit and other items that also come in those types of one serving plastic containers. What you may not realize is that plastic is made from about 70% natural gas. This is a nonrenewable natural resource. Should it be depleted at the rate it is future generations will have to do without it. The option that we have though is to recycle as that will significantly reduce the amount of natural gas that we consume. Eco friendly water bottles are another way that people can save on plastic that has to be recycled. These bottles are refilled so you drink out of them again and again. You don’t have anything to toss into the trash. In 2010 the annual Keep America Beautiful campaign brought in about 189,000 plastic bottles that they found. These items found along roads, in parks, and in landfills. All of them were recycled. If you aren’t recycling your plastic right now you need to make the commitment to do so. You can find location drop offs around your town such as the schools, parking areas, and stores. If you don’t have any such locations it is time to get your community involved to establish them. Create a bin at home where all family members can quickly toss their plastic items. When it is full you can take it to the recycling location. When possible you should rinse out the plastic products before you recycle them. This will help to reduce the chances of contamination. You can also sort your plastic by the type of it. At the bottom of the plastic bottles you will see numbers that indicate the type. However, if you can’t sort them that can be done later on at a facility so don’t avoid recycling plastic because you don’t want to do that task. Another very effective way you can save on plastic is to stop bringing home your shopping items in those bags. Instead, buy reusable eco friendly bags that you can take with you. Keep them in your car so that you always have them available. They are durable and they don’t require you to have tons of plastic bags around your house that will eventually get tossed into the trash."
8,Tire Recycling,"Tires are something that we often don’t think about too much. We know that they are part of our vehicles as well as other modes of transportation. When necessary we replace them on our bikes, cars, and even recreational vehicles that we own.","Tires are something that we often don’t think about too much. We know that they are part of our vehicles as well as other modes of transportation. When necessary we replace them on our bikes, cars, and even recreational vehicles that we own. Yet we fail to think about what happens to all of those tires when we are done with the. They certainly can consume a huge amount of space in the landfills. The process of tire recycling though is a great idea. The sheer amount of tires that aren’t useable any more is unbelievable and it grows every single day. When those tires are melted down though the materials can be made to make new tires. This is less expensive and causes less air pollution than making new tires out of raw materials. The process for recycling tires though is more complex than with other items. That is because of all of the elements that have to be effectively broken down. They can also give off very dangerous types of gas if they are heated. This is why the materials are often used to create new products other than tires too. They have to be treated though with complex measures or harmful gases can come from the melting of the materials. It may surprise you to learn what some of the old tires are now being used for. Some of the common uses include making handbags, shoes, and tarps. They are also used to make a variety of hoses for businesses and even for the engines of vehicles. In many locations though it is voluntary to recycle tires or not so there are still large numbers of them in the landfills. Some select states though have made it illegal to deposit any forms of tires at the landfills. They feel that with effective recycling methods offered there is just absolutely no reason for them to be in landfills. Given the fact that it is estimated there are enough old tires every single year to account for one per person, we all have to take action to make a difference. Technology is also offering us more ways to benefit from the use of rubber. This is encouraging because it gives us the opportunity to use those recycled tires for new options that we hadn’t thought of before. Many people had no idea that old tires were such an environmental concern. Now that you do though stop the cycle of them being wasted and do your part the next time you get a new tire or a set of them. Even though tires can last much longer today than they used to, they won’t last forever. Make sure you have a game plan for recycling them. If you get new tires put on at a service station ask them if they will do it for you. Many of them do for a very small free and that takes them off your hands. They can then turn over volumes of tires for recycling to the right entity. If they won’t take them off your hands then you may need to do some exploring. You can check online to find out where the best place is to deposit them so you don’t store them in your garage. Remember, old tires trap various types of gases that aren’t safe for your family to be around. There are more programs out there though than you think. For example  many towing companies and junk yards are glad to help with tire recycling efforts. Don’t give up until you find a place for them!"
9,Waste Recycling,It is hard to imagine sometimes how the volume of items in a landfill can add up around the world. We may only think of our own contributions but that isn’t the right way to approach it,"It is hard to imagine sometimes how the volume of items in a landfill can add up around the world.  We may only think of our own contributions but that isn’t the right way to approach it. Don’t fool yourself though into thinking that you don’t contribute large amounts of problems to the dump. On average each person in the United States contributes more than 1,200 pounds of such materials that go to landfills. Taking action to cut down on that amount is very important. Before you start to think that it costs too much to recycle items you need to learn the facts. There are many items including glass, plastic, paper, cardboard, and electronics that can be recycled. The cost to break down the materials and then to use them again is only a fraction of what it costs to make the same items from raw materials. At the same time these waste recycling efforts also ensure that we aren’t using as much of our nonrenewable resources such as crude oil to create items. We also can reduce the amount of trees that we cut down to create products. The results of waste recycling offer results all the way around. They aren’t nearly as expensive as tossing items into a landfill and starting all over again. There are some tough concerns out there too such as what to do with motor oil. With so many person and business vehicles out there on the road you have to be extremely careful. A quart of motor oil though can contaminate up to 1 million gallons of water. That is why you have to be part of successfully recycling it. The motor oil can be cleansed through a process and then used again. That can make a significant difference in the quality of our drinking water. Tires are also a big problem and they can quickly add up in our landfills. There are processes in place now though that allows the rubber to be used again for creating various products as well as new tires. Plastic is also a huge problem when it comes to recycling. People tend to think bottled water is better for them due to contamination but that isn’t necessarily the case. If we all stop contributing to waste then we can also remove contamination that gets into the water. It is a constant cycle that we can all stop if we take the initiative to do so. At the same time they dispose of millions of tons of plastic every single year. Even though more of this waste product is being recycled it still isn’t’ enough. Changing to eco friendly reusable bottles will cut down on the plastic. Using shopping bags that you take each time to the store also eliminates you taking home volumes of plastic bags annually. Waste recycling can be a challenge for all households to take on. The fact that only about 20% of what goes to landfills really has to be there could be startling information for you. Be creative when it comes to ways to recycle and ways to reuse items. If you really don’t want to have items anymore donate them. There are always people that can take something such as furniture, appliances, and even electronics. They can make those items work again and that prevents them from going to the landfills. Find out where you can donate such items in your community. Then you can clean out the clutter but also cut down on waste in the landfills. At the same time you can feel good about helping others in need."
10,Water Recycling,Even though all but about 3% of the surface of the Earth is covered with water there is only a portion of it that we can use for drinking.,"Even though all but about 3% of the surface of the Earth is covered with water there is only a portion of it that we can use for drinking. Water recycling is very important if we want to be able to continue using water. Since all living things need it there is no question that this is one of the most important types of recycling that there is. Of course it works hand in hand with many others. For example when plastic is recycled it doesn’t end up in piles at the bottom of the bodies of water. When mobile phones are recycled the chemicals don’t end up in the water. The same is true for batteries being recycled. It is unbelievable the amount of water that can be wasted on any given day. Taking effective measures though will cut down on waste. For example have some types of decorative pots under your rain gutters. You can use the collected rain water to offer to your plants over the next several days. With spring time you may have some quick showers that help you to offer what your garden needs for the next week or so. When it comes to water recycling though most of the efforts occur on the level of a waste water plant. They are able to remove the chemicals and to treat the water so that the forms of contamination that it contains can be removed. This is known as a primary treatment center. There are many times though when a secondary treatment of the water has to take place too. This helps with the water recycling process to ensure that there isn’t anything in it that can be harmful to those who use the water. Due to the many forms of contamination that can exist there are many advanced systems out there. Tertiary treatment for recycling water is quite common too. This is a final step that allows the various chemicals from the primary and secondary treatments to be removed. Getting the raw sewage and water to the plant involves underground pipes and systems. There are also screens that remove solids and particles from the water before it moves on through the system. The next segment of the process involves a grit chamber where the water slowly flows through it. Then various particles such as sand and small rocks can also be removed. Next the water sits so that the organic elements such as oil, fat, and grease, can float to the top and then be successfully removed. The secondary water system removes contamination that is more specific and that wasn’t taken out in the primary system process. The water is mixed with oxygen so that any microorganisms in it can be removed. The water then gets passed through a chlorine chamber that will kill even more microorganisms that may have gotten through the last part of the  process. The amount of water that various industries use is very large. Many of the bigger ones have their own miniature water recycling process. This allows them to safely use water again and again in their processing. It is also a great way for them to reduce the problems associated with contaminated water. There is no doubt that water is one of the best resources in the world. This is why recycling efforts really are important. When there is contamination in the water that doesn’t mean that it will be dark in color or smell bad. It likely won’t taste bad either and the last thing you want is to drink water that isn’t safe. The water recycling process though ensures you can feel good about what you drink."
