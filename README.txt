WEB SCRAPING:  The application scrapes data from the web at application start.  This process should take about 80 seconds to run.
By default this line is commented out because we have the data in Cached_Scraped_Materials_Data.txt.
This can be commented out for a fresh scrape of our data source. Line 16 file gui.py

GITHUB: We used Github to maintain our code. https://github.com/toddbooneii/cancan

TRELLO: We used Trello for project management. https://trello.com/b/vrCnRTTp/2018-dfp-a2-group-2
